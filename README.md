# C---Cpu-Scheduling
CPU Scheduling simulator in C

This is an exercise I was handled in my University course "Operating Systems I". The task is :

Develop a cpu scheduling simulator based on Shortest Job First and Priority Scheduling Algorithms in both premptive and non-preemptive 
functionality. Your input will be given through a text file including a processe's arrival time , service time and priority.
The output will be a Gantt Diagram showing the current active process as well as the mean turnaround time of each process.
The simulation algorithm and the input file names will be given through command-line input.
The project shall include one source file named cpu_scheduling.c along with a readme.txt including your implementation details.


Example calling the program through command line : 
ergasia1 sjf p input.txt ,  which means run Shortest Job First , Preemptive and the input file name is input.txt
